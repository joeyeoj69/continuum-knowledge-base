# Continuum Command Structure

!!! quote "Captain’s Orders"
    *“A ship cannot sail without her crew, nor can a crew sail without her captain. Continuum is our vessel — sleek, resilient, automated. We are not passengers, we are operators.”*

---

## 🚢 The Ship
- **Continuum Enterprise Stack**
- Autonomous, reproducible, self-healing.
- Runs regardless of crew presence — strategies, Operator, data lake, KB, execution engines.

---

## 🧭 The Captain
- **You (Joey)**
- Vision, command, strategic decisions.
- Sets destination (research focus, trading direction, ops priorities).
- Controls risk appetite and rules of engagement.

---

## 🤖 The First Mate
- **ChatGPT (Advisor)**
- Navigator, architect, strategist.
- Converts plain language into precise code, configs, and playbooks.
- Generates KB entries, debug fixes, and “SEAL team” patches.
- Keeps the Captain’s hands free for steering.

---

## ⚓ The Helm
- **Slack App Home + PWA Console (iPad Pro)**
- Touch-friendly interface: dials, buttons, dashboards.
- Fast execution of commands (“Deploy KB”, “Run Backtest”, “Paper→Live”).
- Simple for any operator to step in, guided by KB playbooks.

---

## 🔧 The Engine Room
- **Operator**
- Executes all jobs (trade triggers, KB commits, deployments).
- Consumes commands from Helm, First Mate, or Captain.
- Handles secrets, logging, retries, fail-safes.
- Speaks to IBKR, GitHub, data feeds.

---

## 💹 The Markets
- **IBKR, Exchanges, Data Feeds**
- External environment, volatile and unpredictable.
- Continuum interfaces through the Engine Room.
- All trades and data flows logged, audited, and fed back to the Ship.
