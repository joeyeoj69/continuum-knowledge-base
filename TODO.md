# Continuum Temporary TODO

This is a working scratchpad for short-term Continuum tasks.
It lives in the repo so the Captain can access it easily from iPad.

## 🎯 Immediate (iPad readiness)
- [ ] Finalize Knowledge Base so diagrams render cleanly on iPad
- [ ] Wire Slack App Home / PWA console for touch-first ops
- [ ] Confirm IBKR paper → live controls can be triggered from iPad

## ⏳ Deferred (later)
- [ ] Add docs/architecture/roles.md propaganda page
  - Narrative for Captain / First Mate / Helm / Engine Room / Ship
  - ASCII-safe Mermaid diagram

## Notes
This TODO is temporary — items here will migrate to GitHub Issues or a
more formal project board once iPad ops are stable.
